# Quick-Text

Quick-Text allows user to convert images into text. This can be useful for a 
wide array of purposes such as converting notes paper to digital, text 
extraction from documents, and allows user to search through images. This
project utilizes a react frontend, a Node.js backend, and the EasyOcr library
to process the images. 

# Demo

# How it Works

When a image it uploaded, it is processed and sent to the Node.js backend. Since
Since, EasyOcr is a python library, a child process is spawend and will call on 
the python script to convert the image into text. The result is then returned and
outputed in the frontend.
